/**
 Called when the tint color of UIViewController's view changes.
 
 The system calls this method when your code changes the value of the tintColor property on the view which this UIViewController controls. In addition, the system calls this method if your UIViewController is added as a child view controller that inherits a changed interaction tint color.
 
 In your implementation, refresh the view rendering as needed.
